# Javascript-Web-Games
Some small games (nim, guessing, etc.) to practice javascript, HTML, CSS, and mySQL. Featured on http://jlawman.com/.

Requires bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) and sweet alert (https://t4t5.github.io/sweetalert/). 

Note, the PHP files have been kept private due to their inclusion of mySQL passwords.
